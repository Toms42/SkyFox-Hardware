# SkyFox-Hardware
Formerly Avidrone, this is the repo for all things skyfox hardware! All submodules are linked with the top level SkyFox repo!

#What is SkyFox?
SkyFox is an attempt to create an easy to build, open source version of an active wing ornithopter. In general, creation of active wing ornithopters has been limited to trained engineers and large companies, but we hope to change that! By open sourcing the design, anyone with access to CNC tech and plenty of materials can build one!
